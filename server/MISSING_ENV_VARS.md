# 🔍 Missing Environment Variables

## ❌ **ONLY MISSING VARIABLE**

The following environment variable was missing and needs to be added to your `.env` file:

```bash
# EMAIL_FROM - Required for AutomatedReportService
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@erp.com
```

## 📝 **Add to your .env file**

Just add this one line to your existing `.env` file:

```bash
# Add this line to your .env file
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
```

## 🎯 **Why this was missing?**

- **AutomatedReportService.ts** line 452 uses `process.env.EMAIL_FROM`
- This variable was not included in the original environment template
- Without it, emails will fail to send

## ✅ **All other variables are already covered**

Check `env.automated-reports.example` for the complete list of all other variables.

---

**That's it! Just add EMAIL_FROM to your .env file and you're done.**
