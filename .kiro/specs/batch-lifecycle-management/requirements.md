1. WHEN updating batch status THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately across all interfaces
2. WHEN a batch is started THEN the system SHALL record start time, operator, and machine assignment
3. WHEN a batch is paused THEN the system SHALL track pause duration and reason
4. WHEN a batch is completed THEN the system SHALL record completion time and output quantities
5. WHEN a batch fails quality checks THEN the system SHALL allow rework or rejection with detailed notes
6. WHEN batch status changes THEN the system SHALL notify relevant stakeholders

### Requirement 4: Resource and Material Tracking

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to track material consumption and resource utilization per batch so that I can optimize costs and efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a batch consumes materials THEN the system SHALL deduct quantities from inventory and track costs
2. WHEN machines are assigned to batches THEN the system SHALL track utilization and efficiency
3. WHEN operators work on batches THEN the system SHALL record labor hours and costs
4. WHEN chemicals are used THEN the system SHALL track recipe adherence and consumption
5. WHEN waste is generated THEN the system SHALL record quantities and disposal methods
6. WHEN calculating batch costs THEN the system SHALL include all material, labor, and overhead costs

### Requirement 5: Quality Control Integration

**User Story:** As a quality controller, I want to perform quality checks at each stage so that I can ensure product standards are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing pre-stage quality checks THEN the system SHALL record inspection results and allow/block progression
2. WHEN conducting in-process monitoring THEN the system SHALL track parameters like temperature, pH, and color
3. WHEN completing post-stage quality checks THEN the system SHALL record final results and grade assignment
4. WHEN quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL allow hold, rework, or rejection with detailed documentation
5. WHEN quality data is collected THEN the system SHALL generate quality reports and trend analysis
6. WHEN quality standards are not met THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and corrective actions

### Requirement 6: Production Planning Integration

**User Story:** As a production planner, I want to integrate batch management with production orders so that I can optimize scheduling and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating production orders THEN the system SHALL automatically generate required batches
2. WHEN scheduling batches THEN the system SHALL consider machine availability and capacity
3. WHEN prioritizing batches THEN the system SHALL consider customer orders and delivery dates
4. WHEN planning resources THEN the system SHALL optimize machine and operator assignments
5. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL update production schedules in real-time
6. WHEN delays occur THEN the system SHALL automatically reschedule dependent batches

### Requirement 7: Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a factory manager, I want comprehensive analytics on batch performance so that I can identify improvement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing batch performance THEN the system SHALL provide cycle time, efficiency, and quality metrics
2. WHEN reviewing stage performance THEN the system SHALL show bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
3. WHEN tracking costs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed cost breakdowns and variance analysis
4. WHEN monitoring quality THEN the system SHALL show quality trends and defect patterns
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide customizable dashboards and export options
6. WHEN comparing batches THEN the system SHALL highlight best practices and improvement areas

### Requirement 8: Mobile and Real-Time Access

**User Story:** As a floor supervisor, I want to access and update batch information from mobile devices so that I can manage operations efficiently on the factory floor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive interfaces for all batch operations
2. WHEN scanning barcodes/QR codes THEN the system SHALL quickly access batch information
3. WHEN updating status THEN the system SHALL allow quick status changes with minimal input
4. WHEN viewing dashboards THEN the system SHALL display key metrics optimized for mobile screens
5. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL cache critical data and sync when connection is restored
6. WHEN receiving alerts THEN the system SHALL provide push notifications for critical batch events

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Systems
