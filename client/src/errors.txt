The following issues were resolved:

2. **TypeScript errors in spares components**:
   - Fixed FormSuppliersManagement.tsx to properly access supplier properties from the suppliers array
   - Fixed SuppliersManagement.tsx to use suppliersData.data instead of undefined suppliers variable
   - Fixed type errors with supplierIndex parameter
   - Fixed property access issues (id vs _id)

3. **Missing UI components** - Created missing components:
   - select.tsx (with @radix-ui/react-select dependency)
